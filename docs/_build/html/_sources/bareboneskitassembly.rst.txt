**Thank You** for purchasing our kit and supporting our project.

The Weather Station Project's Barebones Kit is the most basic kit avaliable.

It collects the data of **3** basic environmental features, namely;
 
#. Humidity
#. Temperature
#. Air Pressure

If you have purchased the Pre-Built version, go ahead and skip Steps 1 - 

Step 1 - Opening the Package:
-----------------------------

First things first, open up the ziplock bags and sort the components. You should have the following :

#. 1x Barebones PCB
#. 1x 38P ESP32 Development board
#. 1x BME280 Environmental Sensor
#. 1x 4P â€“ 6P Male Pin Header
#. 2x 19 Female Pin Sockets
#. 1x 4P Female Pin Sockets
#. 1x DC to USB Cable

Sort these into manageable portions for ease of retrival.

Step 2 - Soldeting the ESP32 Pin Sockets:
-----------------------------------------

Insert the included **2x 19 Pin Female Pin Sockets** onto the **ESP32**. This is helpful while soldering as it keeps them **straight and aligned**.

Use the below image as a reference:

Place the ESP32 and the Pin Sockets into the provided *Plated* Holes on the PCB. 

With the text upright, make sure the **Antenna** of the ESP32 is facing towards your **right**.

There is a text *"Antenna"* on the PCB to help you with alignment.

Use the below image as a reference:

Turn the whole affair over and start soldering! 

Make sure each pin gets adequate solder. No more and certainly No less.
