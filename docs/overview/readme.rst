WSP Overview
============

We are a team of High School / College Students from around the world united to solve a common problem. 
Our goal is to make the DIY Electronics hobby as accessible as possible. Weather Station Project sells open-source IoT weather station kits. 
They are hackable and teach electronics and programming.
