Poluino Overview
============

We are a team of High School and College Students from around the world, united to solve a common problem, climate change.
Our goal is to use hobby electronics to create inexpensive weather and air quality data collection solutions. We sell open-source IoT weather station and air quality monitor kits. 
They are hackable and open source and we hope that they can be used to teach electronics and programming to young students so that there is a new generation of engineers and developers that use their skills to fight global issues like climate change.
